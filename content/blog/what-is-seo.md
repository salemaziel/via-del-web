### [](<>)SEO Explained

SEO stands for search engine optimization. 

To understand how SEO works, you must understand how search engines work. Let's use an example: 

A user wants to learn how to play the guitar. They type the phrase “online guitar lessons” into Google. 

In less than a second, Google scans millions of pages across the web. It uses an [algorithm](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-algorithm-history/) to determine which pages have to do with “online guitar lessons.” Then, Google lists the most relevant pages on the search results page. 

When you use SEO principles, you optimize your website for search engines. 

The goal is to get your pages to rank at the top of search results. More people will come across your website and become familiar with your brand. They'll be more likely to read your content and buy your products.
